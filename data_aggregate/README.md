# üì¶ Mutil-data-aggregation-via-Blockchain

A **privacy-preserving secure multi-party computation framework** for verifiable and efficient multidimensional data aggregation over blockchain.

This project provides an end-to-end protocol and evaluation tools for **privacy-preserving data aggregation** using **homomorphic encryption**, **Pedersen commitment**, and **batch ECDSA verification**, with **blockchain-based verifiability** and **fog computing optimization**.
